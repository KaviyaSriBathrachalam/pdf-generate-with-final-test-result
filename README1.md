# pdf-generate-with-final-test-result







this is same as 
         (angular)
         
         https://stackblitz.com/edit/quizzz-display-complete-test-app
         
         but in stackblitz a pdf is not getting generated so we are copying the same application and putting it in vs code.
         
         in that node nodes  is there as a folder and the pdf got generated.
         
         1. ng update @angular/cli
          
         2. npm install
         
         3. ng serve.
